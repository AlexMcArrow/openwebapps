This is a simple test harness / tiny-sdk for Web Activities

START by loading index.html in a browser (file URL is okay).

The harness files are:
    index.html
    webactivities.js

The specific service implementation, which you'll want to modify, are:
    example-activity.js
    login.html

To make this work on an existing service, these files need to be served
from the appropriate domain.
