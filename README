This is an experiment around an open "application store"

What you'll find here:

addon/ 
       A firefox addon capable of rendering, installing and managing
       available applications

server/ 
       An application server, which renders the application store for
       a user.  Including browsing available applications and developers,
       and installation of applications

wallet/ 
       Abstractions which allow bi-directional comminication between
       applications and the wallet server, which allows web applications to
       trigger installation, and check installed status.  The javascript
       abstraction simplifies secure cross domain to the application
       server.
